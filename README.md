# Decision-Analytics
This repository contains the code I wrote for my coursework in the Decision Analytics course (MSDS 460) at Northwestern University.  These files mostly contain Python code focused on topics like linear and nonlinear programming, simulation methods, stochastic decision processes, and queuing.
